# Speech_Recognition
Here we built a simple Speech Recognition using python and speech Recognition library.Built on Googles api. 
#Libraries:
1. Here we used the speech Recognition library you can simply install this by using 
pip install speech Recognition
2. Another one by Audio which is used to read the microphone input you can simply install by using
pip install by Audio
After installation of these two libraries we have to import the speech recognition as source.
